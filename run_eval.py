"""
Run your test questions repeatedly and write the results down.

    python run_eval.py                 three runs, the default
    python run_eval.py --runs 5        more runs
    python run_eval.py --label after   name this run, e.g. before/after a fix

This does the mechanical half of unit 2 for you: it asks each of your questions
the same way three separate times, with caching turned off so you get three
real answers, and writes everything into results/ as a table with one row per
question.

It also puts every question in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` through retrieval and the gate
and records what happened, so criterion 3 — the one about out-of-corpus
questions — has evidence in the same file as the other four. That part costs
nothing: a question the gate refuses never reaches the model.

That table is the raw material for your run log, not the run log itself. The
submission template wants one row per *criterion* — aggregating your questions
up into your criteria is your work, not the script's.

⚠️ What it does NOT do is decide whether an answer was right.

That judgment is yours, and you'll build it in class in unit 2 as `scorer.py`.
Until that file exists, the Run columns carry the raw answers and you read them
yourself. Once it exists — a file called `scorer.py`, with a function
`judge(question, expects, answer, results) -> bool` — this script finds it
automatically and the Run columns carry verdicts instead.

Deciding what counts as correct is the actual lesson. It would be easy to hand
you a scorer; you'd learn nothing from it.
