# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 500 characters maximum
**Overlap:** 1 complete sentence, plus the thread question in every chunk

The advice threads are made of short labelled replies. Across the corpus, a
reply averages about 122 characters, so 500 characters usually holds the
thread question and two or three complete replies without mixing too many
topics. The starter's 800-character windows made 26 chunks and left a
2-character fragment at the end of one document. My chunker moves a reply to
the next chunk when it does not fit, repeats the `THREAD:` question, and
repeats the previous chunk's final sentence as context. It only splits a reply
at sentence boundaries when that one reply is too large to fit by itself.

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `thread_bike_commute.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Is a bike worth it for a 20 minute walk commute?

--- reply 1 (14 votes) ---
Yeah. Cuts an 18 minute walk to about 6. The thing nobody mentions is storage — covered bike parking exists at three buildings and is full by 9am at all three.

--- reply 2 (9 votes) ---
Counterpoint, I sold mine. Between November and March the paths are either icy or salted and salt destroys a drivetrain in one season.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `thread_first_gen.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Anything specific for first-generation students?

--- reply 1 (33 votes) ---
The advising office has a specific programme and it is genuinely good, but it is opt-in and badly publicised. Ask for it by name.

--- reply 2 (41 votes) ---
The thing I'd say: the unwritten rules are the hard part, not the coursework. Ask about the unwritten rules explicitly. People are happy to explain them and nobody volunteers them.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `thread_laptop_specs.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: How much laptop do I actually need for CS courses?

--- reply 1 (31 votes) ---
Less than the recommended spec page says. 16GB of RAM is the one number worth paying for; everything else you'll never notice.

--- reply 2 (18 votes) ---
Adding: the lab machines exist and are better than anything you'll buy. For the heavy assignments people just use those.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `thread_office_hours_etiquette.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Is it weird to go to office hours with no specific question?

--- reply 1 (44 votes) ---
No, and this is the single most common thing first years get wrong. 'I'm following the lectures but I don't feel like I understand the shape of it' is a completely normal thing to say.

--- reply 2 (29 votes) ---
They're usually empty. You are doing the instructor a favour by turning up.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `thread_roommate_conflict.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Roommate situation isn't working. What now?

--- reply 1 (28 votes) ---
Talk to your RA early, and frame it as 'we need help sorting this out' rather than 'move me'. Room changes are possible but the process starts with mediation and skipping that step slows it down.

--- reply 2 (14 votes) ---
Room changes happen at the semester boundary almost always, and mid-semester only in fairly serious cases.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** Can I change my meal plan?

**Answer:**

```
Yes, you can change your meal plan, but you can only change it once and only within the first ten days (thread_meal_plan_tier.txt).

Sources retrieved: thread_commuting.txt, thread_meal_plan_tier.txt
```

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.60

My five in-corpus questions had best distances from 0.254 to 0.583. The five
out-of-corpus questions ranged from 0.810 to 0.929. There was a gap between
0.583 and 0.810, so I chose 0.60: it is above every in-corpus result but below
every unrelated result.

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| What to do if I cannot finish my assignment by deadline? | Yes | 0.478 |
| What study spots do you know that have good coffee nearby? | Yes | 0.426 |
| I want to transfer credits for my major. My department agreed verbally. | Yes | 0.254 |
| Can I change my meal plan? | Yes | 0.414 |
| When does library close | Yes | 0.583 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.929 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.912 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.917 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.810 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.871 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
